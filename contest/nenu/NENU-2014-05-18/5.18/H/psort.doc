Description:
	One day n cells of some array decided to play the following game. Initially each cell contains a number which is equal to it's ordinal number (starting from 1). Also each cell determined it's favorite number. On it's move i-th cell can exchange it's value with the value of some other j-th cell, if |i-j|=di, where di is a favorite number of i-th cell. Cells make moves in any order, the number of moves is unlimited.
	The favorite number of each cell will be given to you. You will also be given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. You are to determine whether the game could move to this state.

Input

	The first line contains positive integer n (1<=n<=100) ¡ª the number of cells in the array. The second line contains n distinct integers from 1 to n ¡ª permutation. The last line contains n integers from 1 to n ¡ª favourite numbers of the cells.

Output

	If the given state is reachable in the described game, output YES, otherwise NO.

Sample input
