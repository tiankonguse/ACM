<h2>B. Wiretapping</h2>
<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

<p>
The WSA used to tap a lot of phone lines - it's a great way of catching
evil plots that the terrorist cells carelessly discuss between themselves using
the public phone system. Lately, the WSA had to reduce costs by cutting back
on traditional wiretapping, and they are trying to determine which few
phone lines they will concentrate their remaining resources on.
<p>
There is a large list of terrorist cell relationships, otherwise known as phone
lines (collected by other means).

<p>
When the Head of Bad People decides to do something Evil, he hatches the Master
Plan; the plan is then broadcast to all cells, using the public phone
network.
<p>
The WSA assumes that terrorists behave rationally, thus:
<ul>
<li> they utilize the smallest possible amount of connections (minimizing number
   of phone calls)
<li> they always distribute the plan to every cell.
</ul>
<p>
A talented young agent has chosen a phone line the tap is installed on.
Your task is to determine the probability of catching the important
broadcast, whichever connection setup the terrorist chose this time.

<h3>Input</h3>
The first line contains two integers <i>N</i> and <i>E</i>, the number of
cells and potential phone connections, respectively. The next <i>E</i> lines are the edges
given as a pair of integers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, each between 0 and <i>N</i>-1,
representing a potential phone call between cells <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.
<p>
The wiretap is placed on the first connection on the list.

<h3>Output</h3>
A single number to 1e-6 precision describing the probability of
catching the message on the tapped line.
