<h2> Prologue: Managing World Security </h2>
<p>
Not all citizens are lawful these days - there are criminals, terrorists,
axes of evil, and many Very Bad People in general. Fortunately large,
international organizations such as WSA (World Security Agency) take care of
your security. To do so, WSA needs to employ sophisticated means of espionage,
including a few methods that are related to information technology.
<p>
This Electronic Contest is part of a test program that aims to use community
resources in aid of the WSA Anti-Evil Spying Operations.
<p>
Disclaimer: the WSA does not interfere with the best interest of lawful
citizens. All operations are targeted on Evil People. If you're Good, you don't
have anything to be afraid of!
