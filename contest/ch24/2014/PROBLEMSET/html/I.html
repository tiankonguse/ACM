<h2>I. Crowd control</h2>
<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">
<p>
Because of crowd management difficulties experienced during recent unfortunate
events regarding the WSA leadership, the WSA decided to investigate
the flow of personnel in public buildings. A stampede of people constrained in
passages partially blocked by columns, plants, janitors, and other debris
caused unwelcome media attention and made it difficult to control
"demonstrators" and other undesirables.
<p>
Based on advice from their private hands-on security experts and other
consultants, the WSA decided that in the future it wishes to arrange
conferences in buildings that can pass people through at a given rate during
escape scenarios.

Your task is to find the maximum possible flow rate of people for each
given layout. (Keep in mind that the carrying capacity of a corridor is
proportional to its cross section.)

<h3>Input</h3>

The layout is represented as a polygon, two sides of which are the entrance
and the exit. All the obstacles are also given as polygons. Other than the
neighbouring sides of polygons, the lines never touch.
<p>
First line contains 3 numbers, first <i>o</i>, the number of obstacles, then <i>b</i> end <i>e</i>,
the beginning and end sides of the outer polygon. The side of
the outer polygon between the <i>b</i>th and (<i>b</i>+1)th vertices is the beginning, and
the side of the outer polygon between the <i>e</i>th and (<i>e</i>+1)th vertices is the end.
0 &lt; <i>b, e</i> &lt; <i>n</i> of outer polygon.
<p>
Next is the outer polygon, the first line of which is <i>n</i>, the number of sides,
then <i>n</i> lines with the x and y coordinates of the <i>n</i> vertices, starting with the
1st vertex. The coordinates are all floating point numbers.
<p>
Next come the <i>o</i> obstacles in the same format.

<h3>Output</h3>
The width of a simple corridor with the equivalent
flow rate to this layout (as a floating point number).
<p>
We accept an output if it is within 0.0001% of the official solution.

In the example, a big obstacle in the middle splits the layout to two corridors.
The bottom corridor has a width of 1, but the top corridor is only 0.89442719 wide
at its narrowest point, marked by the red dashed line, so the total possible flow
is equivalent to a corridor that is 1.89442719 wide.
