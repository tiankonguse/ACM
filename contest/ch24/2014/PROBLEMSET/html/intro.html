<H2>Electronic Contest</H2>

<p>
Welcome to the qualifying round of the 14th International 24-hour Programming
Contest!

<p>
This document is the problem set for the Electronic Contest to be
held on February 8th, 2014.

<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>
The Electronic Contest contains multiple problems. You have all the time
in the world to solve them, but we take submissions from 10:00 to 16:00 CET.
The inputs of the problems can be found in a zip file that you have probably
already downloaded from the website.

<p>
You can use any platform or programming language to solve the problems. We are
interested only in the output files, you don't need to upload the source code
of the programs that solved them.  Once you are done, you can upload your
output files via the submission site:
<a href="http://sub.ch24.org/sub/">http://sub.ch24.org/sub/</a>.
Your solutions will be evaluated on-line.

<p>
Problems are scored in three major ways:
<ul>
	<li><b>Time</b> scoring: these problems have exact solutions. When
	submissions to these are evaluated, a final score is given immediately.
	From one team, only one correct submission will be accepted for each input
	(since the input is either solved or not). Given score decreases with
	time until the end of the contest, so faster solutions get more points.

	<li><b>Competitive</b> scoring: problems that do not have a known "best" solution.
	Outputs for these problems compete against each other, and scores are
	scaled according to the best uploaded output. A team may submit multiple
	correct submissions to one input (only the latest submission will be taken
	into consideration).

	<li><b>Proportional</b> scoring: solutions to these problems will be compared
	against a chosen standard. The final score is calculated from the ratio
	of the evaluated score of the output to a selected constant.
	A team may submit multiple correct submissions to one input (only the latest
	submission will be taken into consideration).

</ul>

<p>
Note that points are awarded per output file and not per problem. If your
solution only works for some of the input files, you will still be awarded
points for the correct output files. A single output file however is either
correct or wrong - partially correct output files are not worth any points.

<h4>Additional information for time scoring:</h4>

<p>
Be quick about uploading the output files, because the scores awarded for every
output file decrease with time. Uploading it just before the end of the contest
is worth <b>70%</b> of the maximum points achievable for the test case. During
the contest its value decreases linearly with time.  However you should also be
careful with uploading solutions. Uploading an incorrect solution is worth
negative points. This penalty is additive, if you upload more incorrect
solutions, you will receive it multiple times. For some problems, we
distinguish format errors (unparsable outputs) from incorrect outputs,
and the former will not be penalised.

<p>
Please note that for time-scored problems there is no point in uploading
another solution for an already solved testcase because you cannot achieve
more points with it. Therefore the system will not register additional
uploads for solved testcases for those tasks.

<p>For some time-scored problems, after submitting an incorrect solution, there
may be a certain short delay (a couple of minutes) until you can re-submit an
updated solution. The delay is applied per team per task per input, and is reported
on the submission web interface.

<h4>Additional information for competitive scoring:</h4>

<p>
In this case there will be no score penalty for uploading a solution later,
so you are able to achieve the maximum amount of points by submitting in
the very last minute - if you beat the other teams' solutions, that is.
However, to avoid overloading our server, after submitting a correct solution,
you may not re-submit an updated solution for a certain short delay (a couple of minutes).
The delay is applied per team per task per input, and is reported on the
submission web interface.

<p>
Scores for competitively scored problems are recalculated occasionally (every
few minutes).  Your points may decrease in time (when another team submits a
better solution than yours).

<p>
Please be aware that only your last submission is considered - not your best one.

<p>
Good luck and have fun!


<h4>About the Submission site</h4>

<p>
The location of the submission site is:
<blockquote>
	<a href="http://sub.ch24.org/sub/">http://sub.ch24.org/sub/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
You will be able to log in to the submission site with your registered
team name and password. After login you can access three main views:


<h5>Team Status</h5>

<p>
You can see your team's status here, with all your submissions and the points
received for them.

<h5>Submit</h5>

<p>
This is where you can post your solution files. You can upload multiple
output files for multiple problems with a single submit.
The naming of the output files must strictly match the following format: X99.out
- where X is the problem's character code followed by a number (1 or 2 digits)
identifying the test case.

<h5>Scores</h5>

<p>
Here you can see the current standings of the contest. This will not be
available in the last hour.
